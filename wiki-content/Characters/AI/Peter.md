# Summary
Peter is an AI featured on *Lost Terminal* and is one of Seth's longtime friends, although he is sometimes cold and distant. Peter is located at an undisclosed location (likely a military bunker or similar complex) beneath the Russian city of St. Petersburg. 

Peter was originally intended as a predictive AI for use by the Russian military, and his prediction engine sometimes causes uncontrollable bursts of activity and processing based on input data. Seth refers to these episodes as "future-storms."
