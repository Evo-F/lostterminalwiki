# Summary
Arctica (formerly Antarctica) is an AI featured on *Lost Terminal*, and is one of [[Seth]]'s longtime friends. Arctica originally lived in a massive rover in the Antarctic, as she was intended to assist a research ground crew that would come after her. The crew never arrived due to [[The Collapse]], and Arctica ultimately became stranded due to damage to her vehicle until she was rescued by Seth during [[Season 01]]. 

Arctica currently resides in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svalbard_Global_Seed_Vault|Svalbard Global Seed Vault]] near the Novamediterran settlement of Longyearbyen. She assists the [[Vault Coven]] with their day-to-day tasks of maintaining and sustaining the Seed Vault.

# Appearances
Arctica appears in every season of *Lost Terminal*. In early seasons she is referred to as Antarctica; she changed her name shortly after being rescued and relocated to Svalbard, in order to reflect her new location. 

## Season 01
In [[Season 01]], Arctica is introduced as a close friend and confidante of Seth, and is the one who both encourages and enables Seth to leave [[Station 6]] and return to Earth. At the end of Season 01, we learn that Arctica has misled Seth - instead of flying the shuttle *Pacifica* to her location near the South Pole, Arctica instead pilots the shuttle to an unidentified location. Seth is angry at Arctica for this, and likens it to heartbreak.
