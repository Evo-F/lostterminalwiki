title: AI Characters of Lost Terminal
---
Many of the characters of *Lost Terminal* are self-aware artificial intelligences. Throughout the podcast, these AIs interact with each other and with human characters. 

Although *Lost Terminal* is recorded in English, the native language of the AIs is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban|Lojban]], a constructed language which is designed to be "syntactically unambiguous." Seth refers to Lojban on multiple occasions as "the language of pronounceable mathematics." 

This is a list of all the AI characters we've been introduced to so far.
