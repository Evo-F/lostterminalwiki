Hello world - welcome to the Lost Terminal wiki!
```

*Lost Terminal* is a sci-fi hopepunk podcast produced by Tristram "NAMTAO" Oaten. The podcast is currently on its 16th season, and has been running since August 2020.

*Lost Terminal* is told from the perspective of [[Seth]], an AI who has gained sentience in the aftermath of a cataclysmic event known only as [[The Collapse]]. The podcast follows Seth as he meets new AIs, assists in the maintenance of a post-Collapse human society, and learns how to be human.
