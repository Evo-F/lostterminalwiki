# Summary
The Novamediterra is the largest known region of concentrated human population following [[The Collapse]]. This region spans the northern section of Earth, mostly above the Arctic Circle. Humans have congregated in this region to escape the southern latitudes rendered inhospitable by high heat and desertification. Although some humans remain outside the Novamediterra, the majority of surviving humans live in the region.
