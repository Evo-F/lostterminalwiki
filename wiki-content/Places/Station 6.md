# Summary
Station 6 was an ESA space station constructed in orbit around Earth in the year 2077. Station 6 is powered by a large solar array and a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG). The solar arrays provides most of the station's electricity, while the RTG acts as a redundant failsafe power supply. The station also has a complement of batteries which have degraded since it was initially assembled.

# Facilities
As we learn in [[Season 01]], Station 6 hosts the following facilities:
- Crew quarters for 12 humans.
- The Hadfield lab.
- A medical bay.
- The Hopper datacentre. 
- A galley.

The original crew of Station 6, including Seth's mother [[Dr. Redwing]], are deceased.
